# Microservices Suite

## Overview

Welcome to the Microservices Suite project! This suite is a collection of Node.js microservices built using the mono-repo strategy and leveraging the Yarn workspaces concept. Each microservice runs in its isolated Docker container, and Kubernetes orchestrates the deployment, providing scalability and efficiency.


## Monorepo strategy benefits for microservices:

- **Enforce DRY Principles:**
  - Collocating code encourages code sharing.
  - Reduce duplication
  - Save time by building on existing boilerplate or reusable functionality.

- **Collaboration:** 
  - Working within the same repository facilitates learning from peers.
  - Enables the adoption of good coding practices and the avoidance of bad ones.

- **Centralized Development Chores:** 
  - Manage common files like `.gitignore` centrally from the root directory
  - Reduce unnecessary repetitions in the codebase.

- **Easily Integrate Development Automation:** 
  - Task runner configurations and docker-compose can be managed from the root directory.
  - simplify the automation of repetitive workflows.

- **Code Sharing Anywhere:** 
  - Publish and import organization-scoped libraries to the npm registry with `yarn publish` and `yarn add <@microservices-suite/foo>`.

- **Easily Containerize and Scale:** 
  - Decouple every microservice to scale individually. 
  - Leverage the `no-hoist Yarn workspace` feature and custom scripts to enable efficient packaging of microservices into isolated containers.

## Technologies Used

- **Yarn Workspaces:** 
  - Simplifies managing multiple packages within a single repository.
  - Encourage code sharing & reduce duplication
  - Make it easier to handle dependencies and scripts.
  
- **Docker Containers:** 
  - Provides lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient containers for packaging and deploying microservices.

### Alpine Images

Alpine images are very minimalistic Linux minidistros that cost you only `~5MB` of real estate. That is why they are used inside your favourite `smart watch ‚åöÔ∏è`. One objective of this project is to `optimize image builds for Continuous Integration (CI)` and `production` environments through the utilization of the slimmest possible images so that you dont bloat ‚ö†Ô∏è your machine in dev and we have a lean server in prod.

#### Key Strategies:

- **Multi-Stage Builds:** 
  - We employ simple Docker constructs like [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) to optimize our image size.

- **[No-hoisting](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2018/02/15/nohoist/) and Symlinking:**
  - While these practices promote the `DRY` (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, they pose a threat to our objective of achieving minimized images. To mitigate this, we leverage `no-hoisting and symlinked libraries`
  - selectively copying only the `node_modules` generated by [non-hoisted workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2018/02/15/nohoist/). 
  - These are optimized to consume less disk space, ensuring that only the essential shared libraries required by a specific service are included, thereby maintaining the slim profile of our images.
  - The service itself will build her core node modules normally inside the dockerfile from her `package.json`

### Kubernetes (k8s)

Kubernetes offers automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, ensuring reliability and scalability.

# Getting Started

Welcome to our project! To ensure a smooth setup and development experience, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:


- **Docker:** 
  - For containerization and managing containerized applications.  
  - [üëâInstall docker here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
  - We love [üíöalpine images](https://alpinelinux.org/) <small,simple,secure>. 
  - You can read about the specific flavor [here](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/main/README.md#how-to-use-this-image)
- **Task Runner Automation Tool:** 
  - For task automation and workflow management.  
  - [üëâInstall task runner here](https://taskfile.dev/installation/).
- **Node.js:** 
  - As the runtime environment for executing the application code.  
  - [üëâDownload LTS version here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- At the project <service_root> create `.env`, `.env.dev` and `.env.staging` files and copy `environment variables` from the `.env.example` file

## Running Services

This project uses a Task Runner Automation Tool to streamline the process of starting services in both development and production. Follow these steps to get your environment up and running:
- You can derive the `service_name` of a service from the workspace name found in the `package.json "name": ` property e.g `@microservices-suite/<service_name>`
 
### Production

To run a service in production:

```bash
task start:<service_name>
```

This command utilizes docker-compose to orchestrate containers and set up necessary networks using the docker-bridge default network.

### Development
For development purposes, use the following command to start a service, substituting <service_name> with the desired service:

```bash
task dev:<service_name>
```

The task runner will handle the setup, ensuring your service is ready for development.

### Running Services Without Docker
If you prefer not to use Docker, you can start services using node `PM2` engine in production or `nodemon` in dev mode:

- For Production: Start the service with the PM2 engine by running:
```bash
task vanilla:start:<service_name>
```
- For Development: Use the Nodemon node engine for a more development-friendly environment:```bash

```bash
task vanilla:dev:<service_name>
```

Using Docker-Compose Directly
Should you need to use docker-compose directly for more control over the container orchestration, you can utilize the standard commands provided by Docker:


```bash
docker-compose up
docker-compose down
```
